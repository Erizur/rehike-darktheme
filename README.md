# Dark theme switcher for Rehike
A userscript that switches to a dark theme on the Rehike YouTube frontend.

# Installation (Tampermonkey)
To install, you have to click on the main.user.js file located in the repository.
After that, click on the "Raw" button located in the menu that will show up, and a new window will appear that will ask you to install the userscript.

# Configuration
As of right now, there isn't a good way to configure the time that the userscript will change themes.
You will have to edit the userscript, more specifically the line that contains the "hour" variable (line 21 as of now)
